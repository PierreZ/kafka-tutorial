# Step-4 Scale-up

We are going to simulate the fact that you will need to spawn more instances on your program.

## TODOs

* Ask the instructor to increase production's rate
* Give the code to your colleague
* Run the code on each laptop with the same Consumer Group
* Cut one of the instance

## Questions

* What happened when a second program has joined the Consumer group?
* what happened when a program is leaving the consumer group?

Congratulations, you learned how to distribute your program using the Consumer group ðŸŽ‰
