# kafka-tutorial
A Kafka tutorial!

I have built this Kafka tutorial as a quick entry point to Kafka.

> ## Kafka
> Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. 

## What are the objectives of this tutorial?

When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:

* consume a message from Kafka,
* produce a message from Kafka,
* have a better grasp around event-driven architecture and microservices using Kafka.

Without further due, [let's get started](docs/step-0.md)!
